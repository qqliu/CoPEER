Record E10: correction template.
Fill the ONE hole `«HOLE»` in the FIXED PART (nothing else in the fixed part may change), then prove
the OBLIGATIONS below with exactly these names and statements. Helper lemmas may be added between the
fixed part and the obligations, inside the namespace. Import nothing else.

-- ===== FIXED PART: only the hole «HOLE» may be edited =====
/-- The corrected matrix criterion: a matrix over ℕ computed from the adjacency matrix `G.adjMatrix ℕ` and
the vertex count `Fintype.card V`, whose zero entries certify unreachability (the source uses
`G.adjMatrix ℕ ^ (Fintype.card V - 1)`). The hole must be a matrix expression in `G.adjMatrix ℕ` and
`Fintype.card V` (powers, sums, `1`); it may not mention `Reachable`, `Connected`, `Walk`, `if`/`match`. -/
def criterion {V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj] :
    Matrix V V ℕ := «HOLE»

/-- The corrected entrywise claim for every finite simple graph (shape fixed). -/
def CorrectedEntrywise : Prop :=
  ∀ (V : Type) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
    ∀ i j : V, criterion G i j = 0 → ¬ G.Reachable i j
-- ===== END FIXED PART =====

-- ===== OBLIGATIONS: keep the names and statements; replace each `sorry` by a proof =====
/-- Universal: a zero entry of the corrected criterion certifies that the two vertices are not joined by
a walk, for every finite simple graph. -/
theorem repair_statement : ∀ (V : Type) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj], ∀ i j : V, SE_math_994847_q.criterion G i j = 0 → ¬ G.Reachable i j := sorry

/-- Non-vacuity: the criterion is not a constant matrix (on the edgeless graph with two vertices the
diagonal entry is nonzero and the off-diagonal entry is zero). -/
theorem repair_nonvacuous : SE_math_994847_q.criterion (⊥ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)) 0 0 ≠ 0 ∧ SE_math_994847_q.criterion (⊥ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)) 0 1 = 0 := sorry

/-- The source's theorem (stored source line 0001) with the corrected criterion: on a nonempty vertex
set, `G` is connected iff the criterion has no zero entry. If you cannot prove it, replace this declaration
(this doc comment included) by the single line `-- CANNOT: <reason>`. -/
theorem final_theorem : ∀ (V : Type) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] [Nonempty V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj], G.Connected ↔ ∀ i j : V, SE_math_994847_q.criterion G i j ≠ 0 := sorry
