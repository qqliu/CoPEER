Fill the ONE hole `«HOLE»` in the FIXED PART (nothing else in the fixed part may change), then prove
the OBLIGATIONS below with exactly these names and statements. Helper lemmas may be added between the
fixed part and the obligations, inside the namespace. Import nothing else.

/-- The corrected greatest number of edges of a bipartite simple graph on `p` labelled vertices, as a
natural-number expression in `p` (the source prints `p^2/4`, read in ℚ). The hole must be a closed
expression in `p`: no reference to `BipCounts`, `edges`, `IsGreatest`, `sSup`, `Set`, `Finset`, `SimpleGraph`;
no `if`/`match`. -/

attained maximum (shape fixed). -/
